    and sometimes a cute older girl shows you a lot of attention, because she’s 
    bored or whatever, and you sort of have this maybe-flirting maybe-not thing 
    going on, right, and then it turns out she’s an ancient warrior who’s killed 
    all your friends and she’s coming for you, and then you both die and she 
    turns up ages later in the broiling heat on a sacred space station and like, 
    it’s complicated. Just saying that it happens all the time. </p>
